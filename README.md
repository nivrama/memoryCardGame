#Instructions for challenge
You have 90 minutes to write a simulation of the "memory" game.

Please stop when you reach this time, regardless of the state of completion and send the test back to me. This allows us to see fairly your development skills.


Here are the rules of the game:

It is a two player game. The computer plays both parts.
16 pairs of cards (32 cards) are laid face down randomly.
Each card is a coloured shape (e.g. red triangle). There are 4 colours (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) and 4 shapes (Square, Circle, Triangle, Oval).
Cards are paired when both their colour and shape are the same (e.g. a red triangle is not a match for a blue triangle).
Players take turns to flip over two cards of their choosing. If they pick a matching pair, they keep both cards. If not, both cards are turned face down again.
The game is over when there are no cards left. The winner is the player with the most cards.
You can take any approach you wish but please show off your PHP knowledge.
